# USCR-parsed-speeches
In this repository, I describe some parsing errors that I came across while working with Gentzkow et al.'s dataset of parsed speeches and phrase counts from the United States Congressional Record [1].

## Disclaimer
Parsing errors are remarkably rare overall in the files I have worked with (Daily Editions of the 110th through 114th Congress).
